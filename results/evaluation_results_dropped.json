        "Valentino Rossi, the three-time motorcycle world champion, is not currently known to be participating in the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC) with a BMW M4 GT3. While Rossi has made a name for himself in motorsport \u2014 including his successful years in MotoGP \u2014 there is no official confirmation of his participation in the 2025 FIA WEC with a BMW M4 GT3.\n\nHowever, it is possible that such a pairing could be discussed or explored in the future. The BMW M4 GT3 is a high-performance race car designed for endurance racing, and it competes in the FIA WEC\u2019s prototype category. It is powered by a BMW M TwinPower Turbo engine, which delivers strong performance and durability required for long races.\n\nIf Rossi were to participate in the FIA WEC, it would represent a significant move from his current motorsport involvement, which includes his return to racing with the MotoGP\u2122 World Championship. Such a transition would be a major step in his career.\n\nFor now, the 2025 FIA WEC lineup and participants are still being confirmed, and no official announcements have been made regarding Rossi\u2019s participation. BMW continues to be an active player in both the GT racing and endurance racing series, and the company may consider such a pairing in the future."

The art car in question is the **BMW M Hybrid V8 Art Car**, which will be driven by BMW M works drivers in the LMGT3 class.\n\n### About Julie Mehretu\nJulie Mehretu (b. 1970) is an esteemed American painter and mixed-media artist based in New York City. Her work often explores themes of geography, architecture, and politics, reflecting on the interconnectedness of global events and individual experiences. Known for her large-scale, layered paintings that combine line drawings, photographs, and spray paint, Mehretu's style incorporates elements of abstraction and conceptual art. Her body of work frequently draws inspiration from source materials such as photographs, maps, and cityscapes.\n\n### The BMW M Hybrid V8 Art Car\nThe 2024 BMW M Hybrid V8 Art Car marks Mehretu's second collaboration with BMW after her first art car for the 2019 24 Hours of Le Mans. For this latest project, the artist has been given unrestricted creative freedom to design a vehicle that will compete in the LMGT3 class.\n\nMehretu\u2019s approach to the art car emphasizes a balance between her artistic vision and the functional requirements of a race car. She has been involved in every stage of the creative process, from conceptual design to final touches. The resulting car will feature a unique wrap designed by Mehretu, reflecting her signature style and aesthetic.\n\nThe art car will be driven by the BMW M Motorsport teams in the LMGT3 category, which features BMW M4 GT4 cars. These cars are designed for both performance and reliability, making them ideal for endurance racing.\n\n### Significance of the Project\nThe collaboration between Julie Mehretu and BMW represents a fusion of art and engineering, highlighting the innovative spirit of both the artist and the automotive manufacturer. It also underscores the cultural impact of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, one of the oldest and most prestigious endurance races in the world.\n\nThe 2024 edition of the race will take place from **6 to 8 June** at the Circuit de la Sarthe in France.
